# 🎯 EVM Mint BOT — OpenSea Raw Transaction Sniper

OpenSea raw transaction sniper for EVM NFT whitelist / FCFS mints.

This repo is **raw-only by design**. Users do not need to understand SeaDrop proof tuples, mint params, ABI routes, or manual allowlist calldata. OpenSea prepares the raw mint transaction; this bot polls for it, then broadcasts with a same-nonce gas ladder.

---

## ⚠️ Security First

Use a **burner wallet** only.

Never share or commit:

- `.env`
- `PRIVATE_KEY`
- `OPENSEA_JWT`
- premium RPC URLs
- logs containing mint/session data

After a mint war, rotate or clear secrets from `.env`.

---

## ✨ What This Bot Does

- Polls OpenSea GraphQL until a raw mint transaction is released
- Requires a fresh OpenSea JWT from your browser session
- Supports preflight, dry-run, JWT check, raw transaction test, and deep analyzer
- Broadcasts with same-nonce gas ladder
- Masks secrets in logs
- Keeps secrets out of git via `.gitignore`

---

## 📦 Install

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

---

## 🔑 Configure `.env`

Minimum config:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=***
RPC_URL=https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com
NFT_CONTRACT=0xYourNftContract
CHAIN_IDENTIFIER=ethereum
QUANTITY=1

MINT_MODE=opensea_raw
OPENSEA_COLLECTION_SLUG=your-collection-slug
OPENSEA_JWT=eyJ_replace_with_fresh_token

DRY_RUN=true
```

`MINT_MODE` is locked to raw mode:

```env
MINT_MODE=opensea_raw
```

---

## 🌐 Supported Chains

Set `CHAIN_IDENTIFIER` to match your RPC and OpenSea drop chain.

| Chain | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Ethereum | `ethereum` |
| Base | `base` |
| Arbitrum | `arbitrum` |
| Optimism | `optimism` |
| Polygon | `polygon` |
| Abstract | `abstract` |
| Zora | `zora` |
| Blast | `blast` |
| Shape | `shape` |

---

## ⏱️ Get Fresh OpenSea JWT

JWT is the browser login/session token OpenSea uses after your wallet is connected.

Get it **5–10 minutes before FCFS / whitelist phase**.

1. Open the OpenSea collection page
2. Connect/login your mint wallet
3. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
4. Go to **Network** tab
5. Filter/search `graphql`
6. Refresh the OpenSea page
7. Click a `graphql` request
8. Open **Headers**
9. Find:

```txt
Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
```

10. Copy only the token after `Bearer `
11. Paste it into `.env`:

```env
OPENSEA_JWT=eyJxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

JWT expires. If `npm run jwt-check` says it is expired or close to expiry, copy a fresh one.

---

## 🧪 Pre-War Checks

### 1. Syntax check

```bash
npm run check
```

### 2. JWT check

```bash
npm run jwt-check
```

Validates JWT format and expiry time.

### 3. Target analyzer

```bash
npm run analyze
```

Checks:

- RPC connection
- chain id
- NFT contract code
- OpenSea stage metadata when available
- fee recipient hints

### 4. Raw transaction test

```bash
npm run raw-test
```

Checks whether OpenSea currently returns a raw mint transaction for your wallet/session.

Exit code notes:

- `0` = raw tx available
- `2` = request worked, but raw tx not released yet
- `1` = config/network/auth error

### 5. Deep browser analyzer

```bash
npm run analyze-deep
```

Uses Playwright to open the OpenSea page and watch frontend network requests.

Install Playwright only if you need this:

```bash
npm install -D playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

Useful env:

```env
OPENSEA_DROP_URL=https://opensea.io/collection/your-collection
HEADLESS=true
ANALYZE_WAIT_MS=15000
```

This does **not** sign or broadcast. It only inspects OpenSea frontend/network behavior and writes a report to `logs/`.

---

## 🚀 Run The Sniper

### Dry-run first

```bash
npm run dry-run
```

Dry-run polls OpenSea, builds cost summary if raw tx exists, estimates gas, and checks balance.

No broadcast.

### Live mint

```bash
DRY_RUN=false npm start
```

Only run live after:

- JWT is fresh
- preflight is clean
- raw-test looks good or phase is about to open
- burner wallet has enough gas

Do **not** close the terminal during FCFS. The bot polls until raw tx is released or polling limit is reached.

---

## ⚡ Polling Strategy

Safe default:

```env
OPENSEA_POLLS=120
OPENSEA_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=1000
```

War mode:

```env
OPENSEA_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=500
```

Aggressive/risky:

```env
OPENSEA_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=250
```

Lower interval = faster detection, higher rate-limit risk.

---

## ⛽ Gas Ladder

Balanced default:

```env
FIRE_GAS_TIERS=300,220,160,120
```

Brutal FCFS war:

```env
FIRE_GAS_TIERS=700,500,350,250,150
```

Same nonce means only one transaction should be mined, but the highest accepted tier can still be expensive on Ethereum mainnet.

## 🧾 Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | Burner wallet private key |
| `RPC_URL` | Yes | EVM RPC endpoint |
| `NFT_CONTRACT` | Yes | Drop contract address |
| `CHAIN_IDENTIFIER` | Yes | `ethereum`, `base`, etc |
| `QUANTITY` | Yes | Mint quantity |
| `MINT_MODE` | Yes | Must be `opensea_raw` |
| `OPENSEA_COLLECTION_SLUG` | Yes | OpenSea collection slug |
| `OPENSEA_JWT` | Yes | Fresh OpenSea Bearer token |
| `OPENSEA_POLLS` | Yes | Poll attempts |
| `OPENSEA_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Yes | Delay between polls |
| `FIRE_GAS_TIERS` | Yes | Same-nonce gas ladder percentages |
| `DRY_RUN` | Yes | Keep `true` until ready |

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

### `Missing OPENSEA_JWT in .env`

Copy a fresh Bearer token from OpenSea Network tab.

### `OPENSEA_JWT is expired`

JWT expired. Re-copy a fresh token 5–10 minutes before mint.

### `OpenSea raw transaction not released`

Common causes:

- phase not open yet
- wallet not eligible
- JWT expired / wrong wallet session
- wrong collection slug
- OpenSea GraphQL changed

### `NFT_CONTRACT has no code`

Wrong chain, wrong RPC, or wrong contract.

### `Insufficient balance`

Top up burner wallet or lower gas/quantity.

### `gas too expensive`

Lower:

```env
FIRE_GAS_TIERS
BASE_FEE_MULTIPLIER
MAX_PRIORITY_GWEI
```

## 🛡️ Safety Design

- No hidden transfer logic
- No private key upload
- No telemetry
- No obfuscated code
- No suspicious dependencies
- Live broadcast requires explicit `DRY_RUN=false`
- Deep analyzer does not sign or spend gas

---

## 📌 Recommended War Flow

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# fill .env
npm run jwt-check
npm run analyze
npm run raw-test
npm run dry-run
DRY_RUN=false npm start
```

Run it a few minutes before FCFS. Keep JWT fresh. Use burner wallet. Keep terminal alive.
